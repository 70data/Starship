üöÄ Starship is to modern Observability on Kubernetes platform, as ChatGPT is
to consumer knownledge discovery.
üêù eBPF enables instrumentation-free data collection, and ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112656580/219543881-046af389-ca10-4dda-b79a-a60088a1220a.png) WASM complements eBPF's
inability to perform complex data processing.

Starship is developed by [Tricorder Observability](https://tricorder.dev/),
proudly supported by [MiraclePlus](https://www.miracleplus.com/) and the Open Source
community.

## Get Started

‚ò∏Ô∏è  [Helm-charts](https://github.com/tricorder-observability/helm-charts),
install Starship on your Kubernetes cluster with helm.

We recommend start with [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
**v1.29.0** or newer.

```
# First start the minikube cluster, and make sure have at least 8 cpus and
# 8196MB memory.
minikube start --cpus=8 --memory=8192

# Create a namespace for installing Starship.
# Do not use a different namespace, as our documentation uses this namespace
# consistently, and you might run into unexpected issues with a different
# namespace.
kubectl create namespace tricorder
```

Then follow the [helm-charts installation](
https://github.com/tricorder-observability/helm-charts#install).

## Architecture

ü§ø Before diving into the code base:

- Starship is built for Kubernetes platform. Starship provides all things you'll
  need to get started with Zero-Cost (or Zero-Friction) Observability.
- Starship provides `Service Map`, the most valuable information for
  understanding Cloud Native applications, and numerous other data, analytic,
  and visualization capabilities to satisfy the full spectrum of your needs in
  running and managing Cloud Native applications on Kubernetes.
- The core of starship is the tricorder agent, which runs data collection
  modules written in your favorite language, and are executed in eBPF+WASM.  You
  can write your own modules in C/C++ (Go, Rust, and more languages are coming).

Tricorder is working on supporting all major frontend languages of writing eBPF
programs, including:
* [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)
* [BPFtrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace)
* Rust ([readbpf](https://github.com/foniod/redbpf)
  [aya](https://github.com/aya-rs/aya))

Additionally, [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf)-style eBPF binary
object files are supported as well.

## Components

* Starship [Tricorder](src/agent) (aka. Starship Agent): a data collection agent
  running as daemonset. Agent executes eBPF+WASM modules and export structured
  data to storage engine.  The code lives in [src/agent](src/agent).
* Starship [API Server](src/api-server): manages Tricorder agents, and Promscale
  & Grafana backend server; also supports management Web UI and CLI.  The code
  lives in [src/api-server](src/api-server).
* Starship [CLI](src/cli): the command line tool to use Starship on your
  Kubernetes cluster. The code lives in [src/cli](src/cli).
* Starship [Web UI](ui): a Web UI for using Starship.  The code lives in
  [ui](ui).

### 3rd party dependencies

* [Promscale](https://github.com/timescale/promscale): A unified metric and
  trace observability backend for Prometheus & OpenTelemetry.  Starship use
  `Promscale` to support Prom and OTel.
* [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana): Starship use `Grafana` to
  visualize Observability data.

### Prepherials

* [Kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) (KSM):
  listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of
  the objects. Starship use `KSM` to expose cluster-level metrics.
* [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus): collects metrics from
  `KSM` and then remote write to `Promscale`.
* [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry): for distributed tracing
  and other awesome Observability features.

## Building Starship

The development environment is based on Ubuntu.
The easiest way to get started with building Starship is to use the dev image:

```
git clone git@github.com:tricorder-observability/starship.git
cd starship
devops/dev_image/run.sh
# Inside the container
bazel build src/...
```

`devops/dev_image/run.sh` is a script that mounts the `pwd` (which is the root
of the cloned Starship repo) to `/starship` inside the dev image.

### Provision development environment on localhost
You can use Ansible to provision development environment on your localhost.
First install `ansible`:

```
sudo apt-get install ansible-core -y
git clone git@github.com:tricorder-observability/starship.git
cd starship
sudo devops/dev_image/ansible-playbook.sh devops/dev_image/dev.yaml
```

This installs a list of apt packages, and downloads and installs a list of other
tools from online.

Afterwards, you need source the env var file to pick up the PATH environment
variable (or put this into your shell's rc file):
```
source devops/dev_image/env.inc
```
Afterwards, run `bazel build src/...` to build all targets in the Starship repo.
